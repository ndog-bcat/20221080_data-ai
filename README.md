this is main branch

Reflection

First of all, I was not sure what editor to use when installing git. In google, they recommended vscode for beginners but I saw 'vi' in the professor's lecture video. And I thought I have to use 'vim' to work efficiently. So I decided to use vim and get familiar with it. But when I entered 'vim README.md' in the windows terminal, it didn't responded correctly. It was problem with environment variable path. In windows terminal, I couldn't see what branch I'm using, so I just used git bash.

Secondly, I was confused what is difference between pushing dev branch to github and merging two branches. I thought they were same thing. But later I realized they are completely different. Problem was that I didn't understand what is pushing and what is merging. Now I think I know what they are.

Lastly, I was unfamiliar with using git bash and vim. I made line break between lines, but on github, they were on same line. When I added blank line between lines, and then they were split into two lines. And editing README.md in vim was very unfamiliar too.

Now I think I'm getting used to using git bash and git things. But I think I should work with it more to know about them completely
